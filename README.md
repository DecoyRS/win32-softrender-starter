# win32-softrender-starter
The absolute minimum code to have a runtime display of image buffer on Windows platform with hot reloading render code that allows you to quickly iterate over your algorithms without the need of restarting the whole programm.

This project is inspired by and based on the work of the almighty [Casey Muratori](https://caseymuratori.com/about), author of [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/).

As a game developer myself I've been always fascinated by the rendering aspect of the games.
And in the light of the recent trends, raytracing rendering has been gaining quite a lot of love, especially with posts like [Daily Pathtracer](https://aras-p.info/blog/2018/03/28/Daily-Pathtracer-Part-0-Intro/) from Aras Pranckeviƒçius.
I've come across one particularly interesting papers from [Peter Shirley](https://twitter.com/Peter_shirley/). Although they are really easy and intertaining to read, I didn't like the necessity to relaunch the programm every time I need to check my changes and open external editor to actually see what my rendered has generated.

This project's aim is to give a sandbox for everyone like me, who wants to play around with rendering techniques, but doesn't want to spend too much time on preparations.
